		@brief Simple block-allocator that internally allocates a large chunk then allocates smaller blocks from this larger block
		@details This is a simple block allocator that internally allocated a large single block from the C++ free-store (or operating system)
		and then allows calls to allocate small blocks from that one block.  These small blocks cannot be individually deallocated, but rather
		are all deallocated all at once when rewind() is called.  C++ allocators can easily be defined that allocate from a single object of this
		type, but that is left for other classes to manage (for example, class allocator_cpp).
		
		If the large memory block "runs out" then a second (and subsequent) block are allocated from the C++ free-store and they
		are chained together.  If the caller askes for a single piece of memory larger then that default_allocation_size then this
		class will allocate a chunk of the required size and return that to the caller.  Note that there is wastage at the end of 
		each chunk as they cannot be guaranteed to lay squentially in memory.
		
		By default allocations by this class are not aligned to any particular boundary.  That is, if 1 byte is allocated then the next memory
		allocation is likely to be exactly one byte further on.  So allocation of a uint8_t followed by the allocation of a uint32_t is likely to
		result in the uint32_t being at an odd-numbered memory location.  Call malloc() with an alignment value to allocate an aligned piece of memory.
		On ARM, all memory allocations are word-aligned (sizeof(void *) by default because unaligned reads usually cause a fault.
		
		The use of new and delete in C++ (and malloc and free in C) is expensive as a substantial amount of work is necessary in order to maintain
		the heap.  This class reduces that cost - it exists for efficiency reasons alone.
	
		This allocator is thread safe.  A single allocator can be called from multiple threads concurrently and they will each
		return a valid pointer to a piece of memory that is not overlapping with any pointer returned from any other call and is of
		the requested size.
