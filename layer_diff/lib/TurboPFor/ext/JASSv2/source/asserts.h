	JASS_ASSERT()

/*!
	@brief Drop in replacement for assert() that aborts in Release as well as Debug.
	@details Each of the JASS classes has a unit test function with the signature static void unittest(void).  These unit tests
	call assert() if something isn't as expected.  However, as assert compiles to an empty function on release, there is no
	obvious way to make the unit tests also work in release.  To get around this, call JASS_assert() rather than assert() and
	the assert will also work in release.
	
	If you want a genuine assert() that goes away in release, then call assert().  If you want an assert() for unittests call
	JASS_assert().
	
	@param expression [in] The expression to check.
