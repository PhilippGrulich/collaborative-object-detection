		@brief Thread-safe unballanced binary tree that uses an allocator, and consequently never calls delete on elements or keys.
		@details Data is kept in nodes and in-order with low on the left and high on the right.
		Elements are addressed using the operator[key] syntax seen with a std::map.  Note that this syntax makes it impossible to have duplicate keys.
		There is no way to remove an element from the binary tree once added.  Note that KEY and ELEMENT must take the allocator in their constructors.
		@tparam KEY The type used as the key to the element (must include KEY(allocator, KEY) copy constructor)

				The details of which are given on that thread but repeated here:
				
				@verbatim
					What you're looking for is a successor algorithm.

					Here's how it can be defined:

					*First rule: The first node in the tree is the leftmost node in the tree.
					*Next rule: The successor of a node is:
						*Next-R rule: If it has a right subtree, the leftmost node in the right subtree.
						*Next-U rule: Otherwise, traverse up the tree
							*If you make a right turn (i.e. this node was a left child), then that parent node is the successor
							*If you make a left turn (i.e. this node was a right child), continue going up.
							*If you can't go up anymore, then there's no successor
							
					As you can see, for this to work, you need a parent node pointer.

				Source code in Java is provided in that thread.
