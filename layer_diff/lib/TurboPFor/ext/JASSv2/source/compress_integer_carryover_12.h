		@brief Carryover-12 integer compression
		@details Simple-9 compression bin-packs as many integers as possible into a single 28-bit word with a 4-bit selector (to make 32-bits).
		Relative-10 uses 2-bit selector to encode the current word reltive to the previous word.  In Carryover-12 the 2-bit selector is stored
		in the previous word if there is room.  This means that sometimes its possible to use 30-bits in the integer and sometimes 32-bits (if the
		selector is in the previous word).
