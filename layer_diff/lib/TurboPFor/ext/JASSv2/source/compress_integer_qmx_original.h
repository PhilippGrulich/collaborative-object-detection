		@brief QMX as orignally published (with bug fixes and a a few method name changes)
		@details The original QMX source code with a bug fix to do with short string encoding
		and with the interface changed to fit the JASS requirements.  For details see:

		A. Trotman (2014), Compression, SIMD, and Postings Lists, Proceedings of the 19th Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS 2014)
		
		QMX is a version of BinPacking where we pack into a 128-bit SSE register the following:
		256  0-bit words
		128  1-bit words 
		 64	 2-bit words
		 40  3-bit words
		 32  4-bit words
		 24  5-bit words
		 20  6-bit words
		 16  8-bit words
		 12 10-bit words
		  8 16-bit words
		  4 32-bit words
		or pack into two 128-bit words (i.e. 256 bits) the following:
		 36  7-bit words
		 28  9-bit words
		 20 12-bit words
		 12 21-bit words
		
	This gives us 15 possible combinations.  The combinaton is stored in the top 4 bits of a selector byte.  The
	bottom 4-bits of the selector store a run-length (the number of such sequences seen in a row.

	The 128-bit (or 256-bit) packed binary values are stored first.  Then we store the selectors,  Finally,
	stored variable byte encoded, is a pointer to the start of the selector (from the end of the sequence).

	This way, all reads and writes are 128-bit word aligned, except addressing the selector (and the pointer
	the selector).  These reads are byte aligned.

	Note:  There is currently 1 unused encoding (i.e. 16 unused selector values).  These might in the future be
	used for encoding exceptions, much as PForDelta does.
	
	This code differes from the original as published in two ways.  First, two bugs are fixed (an overflow on reading 
	the buffer to be encoded, and an edge case at end of encoded string), and it has been changed to remove SIMD-word
	alignment requirement.
