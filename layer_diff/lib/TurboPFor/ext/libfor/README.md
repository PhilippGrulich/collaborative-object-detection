libfor - Fast C Library for Frame of Reference Integer Compression
======================

An ANSI C library with a fast scalar (non-SIMD) implementation for
Frame of Reference (FOR) integer compression. It works on Linux,
Microsoft Windows and most likely all other sane systems.

FOR can compress sorted and unsorted integer sequences.

In addition, the library can perform operations directly on compressed data:

   * select: returns a value at a specified index
   * linear search: for unsorted sequences, or short sorted sequences
   * lower bound search: based on binary search, for sorted sequences
   * append: appends an integer to a compressed sequence

Simple demo
------------------------

    #define LEN 100
    uint32_t in[LEN] = {0};
    uint8_t out[512];

    // Fill |in| with numbers of your choice
    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; i++)
      in[i] = i;

    // Now compress; can also use for_compress_sorted() if the numbers
    // are sorted. This is slightly faster.
    uint32_t size = for_compress_unsorted(&in[0], &out[0], LEN);
    printf("compressing %u integers (%u bytes) into %u bytes\n",
            LEN, LEN * 4, size);
 
    // Decompress again
    uint32_t decompressed[LEN];
    for_uncompress(&out[0], &decompressed[0], LEN);

Usage
------------------------

It can't be more simple:

    make

To run the tests:

    ./test

Where is this used?
----------------------

I use this library to compress 32bit integers for upscaledb, a very
fast embedded key/value store (see http://upscaledb.com). 

If you would like me to add your application to this list then please send
me a mail at chris@crupp.de.

Requirements
------------------------

This library only works with little-endian CPUs.

Tested on Linux and Windows (Visual Studio 2013). Porting it should not
be difficult.
